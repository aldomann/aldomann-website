Hi there! I'm Alfredo. I am a Physicist finding a path in Data Science. I have a passion for technology, maths, and design. I've collaborated on several Open Source projects, especially those related to the [Ubuntu Community](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/aldomann).

One of the things I really enjoy doing in my daily life is programming. You can find all my projects on my [GitHub](http://github.com/aldomann) profile.

### Why a blog?

One of the things that made me create this blog is the feedback from the GNOME community about some of my mockups (originally published on [DeviantArt](https://aldomann.deviantart.com/gallery/45668852/Mockups)) whenever I would publish one on the (now defunct) [GNOME Design](https://plus.google.com/communities/116790799251153536343)'s Google+ community. But what really pushed me to do it was [Bilal Elmoussaoui](https://twitter.com/bil_moussaoui)'s work on one of my mockups: Audio Cutter.

So my idea is to start publishing my mockups here, either additionally or only here (I still have to decide it).

One of the things I also want to write about here is Linux in general and updates about the book I'm writing about $\LaTeX$: [The Alf Way to LaTeX](https://github.com/aldomann/the-way-to-latex).

  In the frame of [RENEB](https://www.reneb.net/), we are developing [Biodose Tools](https://biodosetools-team.github.io/biodosetools/), an Open Source R Shiny application to help professionals and researchers on Biological Dosimetry to perform several computations and statistical analyses. We also aim to clarify and document the tests used and to propose those considered most appropriate.

  Our end-goal is to replace the current software used by different laboratories and to standardise the used statistical methods. This will have a major impact in Laboratory Intercomparison tests for Quality Assurance.
